    Fix misc sound bugs (#845)
    
    * Change play function to return current sound instead of undefined
    
    Change play to also return sound if unable to play
    
    * Change ADSR function to accept ratios of duration rather than absolute values
    
    * Changed ADSR function to have a linear decay
    
    The previous version of ADSR (Attack, decay, sustain, release) uses an exponential decay function. This may cause issues because the tail end of the decay does not line up with the next part of the sound, which can cause glitches. Thus a linear function is used instead, because the tail end of the decay will match up exactly. There is the added benefit of the function being easier to read and code.
    
    * Change play to display error if a sound is already playing
    
    * Fix error not displaying when calling unsafe play when sound is already playing
    
    * Fix adsr issues
    * Create absolute_adsr function that accepts durations in seconds
    * Change instruments to use absolute_adsr
    * Fix typo in adsr comments
    
    * Remove absolute_adsr and tweak adsr envelope values for instruments
    
    * Correctness fix for play function jsdoc

    Substitution model visualizer (#803)
    
    * Add SUBST button
    
    Modify class definitions, instantiations to incorporate SUBST button
    
    Remove SUBST button from controlbar
    
    Create SubstTimeline and SubstVisualizer
    
    Add a SUBST tab to the sidebar
    
    Fix problem with range input not sliding in SUBST visualizer tab
    
    22 march 2019
    
    Remove compile error; confirm can generate code from tree and display
    
    Add functionality to handle slider change
    
    Add SUBST visualizer functionality to maximum extent permissable by current state of SUBST substitutor

    Add buttons to SUBST timeline to allow for fine-grained control over stepping through substitution
    
    Add checks to disable SUBST timeline control buttons when appropriate
    
    "When appropriate" -> for example, all buttons are disabled when the program has not yet been run, and hence there is nothing to step through; button to go to previous step is disabled when already at first step.
    
    Add code such that SUBST interpreter is only used when the SUBST tab of the sidebar is open
    
    Add keyboard controls to SUBST timeline buttons

    * Fix excessive margins of header elements in assessment briefing overlay
    
    * Fix excessive margins in MCQ hint notifications in assessments
    
    * Add onClickProgress to enforce question blocking for Paths

    * Repair broken tests; override default size of <canvas> in Autograder
    
    * Implemented elevated prepend for guided paths. (Postpend still missing methods).
    - Split running editor/tests into 4 phases - prepend, student's code, postpend, tests.
    - prepend and postpend are elevated privilege.
    - student's code is blocked from accessing functions not in their deployment.
    - student's code cannot use source features > than their deployment.
    
    * Fixed two tests by fixing the mocks. (mocks missing env frames)
    
    * Implemented support for postpend library functions.
    - This is done by hiding the extra functions within an array while deallocating them.
    - The array has a randomly generated name ;)
    - The extra functions are restored before postpend, and deleted again after that.
    
    * Fixed test for line numbers in evalCode.
    
    * Skip last two tests because they are overspecified.
    
    * Linting whitespace.
    
    * Remove unnecessary lines.
    
    * Rename EVAL_TESTCASE_SILENT to EVAL_SILENT; add comments
    
    * Rewrite tests for EVAL_EDITOR and EVAL_TESTCASE to assert some behaviour

    Contributors page new (#655)
    
    * Designed the new contributors page with link from navbar instead of the dropdown.

Updated content of About dropdown as well as updated some test snapshots.
    
    * Ran npm run format to format code.
    
    * Removed the Contributors menu item under the dropdown. Added sicp repo's contributors as well into the list of contributors. References issue #609 and new pr #655.

    Submit and show MCQ Answer (#228)
    
    * Add handleOptionSelect handler for MCQChooser
    
    * Use handleOptionSelect in Button
    
    Had to use a curried function to get around the "Lambdas forbidden in
    rendering method" rule (and consequently save performance)
    
    * Use handleMCQSubmit name instead
    
    * Change mcq question prop -> mcqProps
    
    Thus, anything that calls workspace will have to provide a method to
    handle MCQs, if the question is an MCQ question
    
    * Pass correct props for GradingWorkspace
    
    * Use correct props for AssessmentWorkspace
    
    * Remove unused import from workspace
    
    * Format AssessmentWorkspace
    
    * Add localState to remove visual lag of choosing
    
    Before: Option chosen (active momentarily) -> dispatch (button inactive
    due to current state) ->
    component updated with answer (active)
    
    Now: Constructor takes in current option from state -> Option chosen (active momentarily) -> local state updated (active) and dispatch is sent -> any update from the dispatch will cause constructor to set the state (during render) to the new option
    
    * Pass in chosenOption prop from workspace parents
    
    * Format and update a test
    
    * Add workaround for mcq being passed as string
    
    The issue has been created at the backend cadet repo -- #162.
    As triple equality was used to verify if the button should be pressed,
    this caused all the equality checks to return false (string is not ===
    any number). I've added a workaround to parse the received string.
    
    * Move parsing to the backend saga
    
    * Format files
    
    * Make resetWorkspace accept arguments to set values

    passed in.

    Add support for cruves (#217)
    
    * Add most externals
    
    * Change clear() -> clear_viewport()
    
    This is a clear (lol) clash between the browser's clear() function, that
    removes all console output
    
    * Make getReadyWebGLForCanvas reset canvas
    
    Now, all init scripts just call that function.
    
    * Move initRuneBuffer to getReadyWebGLForCanvas
    
    * Remove init files
    
    We shall use a change in externals to decide this
    
    * Remove init files from index script
    
    * Add renderMode property
    
    * Diversify mock libraries
    
    Using all 4 external libraries available, and with the renderMode option
    
    * Add renderMode param to components and containers
    
    * Fix container imports and args
    
    Application (URL parsing) does not support library yet so it does not
    need to use the renderMode param.
    
    * Add renderMode argument for clearContext action
    
    * Refactor externals definitions
    
    - Separated 2d and 3d runes
    - Nicer names
    
    * Change clearContext usage in saga
    
    - Use null for things that should not affect clearContext
    - Generate a renderMode for SELECT_PLAYGROUND_EXTERNAL
    - Add a takeAll for CLEAR_CONTEXT that gets the canvas ready
    
    * Add documentation for saga
    
    * Format and update tests
    
    * Move externals definitions to a new file
    
    * Fix enum and import
    
    * Change renderMode -> externalLibraryName in usage
    
    components and containers
    
    * Change clearContext action definition
    
    * Update mock assessmentAPI
    
    * Fix import order
    
    * Change clearContext usage and CLEAR_CONTEXT saga
    
    To use the correct arguments, and swtich case for the
    ExternalLibraryNames
    
    * Remove shallow check for assessment
    
    * Add documentation for clearContext
    
    * Fix mock externals not loading
    
    * Change update method for content Workspaces
    
    i.e AssessmentWorkspace and GradingWorkspace.
    We depend on the componentDidUpdate being triggered, which is ensured by
    componentDidMount. This is because multiple dispatches one
    componentDidMount/componentDidUpdate does not work
    
    * Format files
    
    * Add delay for mock backend calls
    
    * Fix import order
    
    From rebase
    
    * Simplify loading and resetting logic for workspace
    
    This was causing some weird behaviour, but I think now the logic is
    simplier and it works better
    
    * Fix mock grading being passed as an object
    
    * Format files
    
    * Move ExternalLibraryName/ExternalLibraryNames
    
    * Format reducer
    
    * Remove delay

    Use context properties instead of state (#191)
    
    * Remove sourceChapter from state
    
    * Use context's chapter in reducers and saga
    
    And also one container
    
    * Add comment
    
    Note that as of now, playground chapter switching works.
    
    * Move current assessmentId check
    
    to AssessmentWorkspace
    
    * Update test props
    
    * Move props from assessment -> AssessmentWorkspace

    - Moved state props
    - Moved dispatch props (and import references)
    
    * Format and update tests
    
    * Use context.runtime.isRunning
    
    As of now, interruption of runtime works, but the stop button does not
    get reset. I suspect that this is because of the order of calling
    between saga vs the reducers.
    
    * Split INTERRUPT_EXECUTION to BEGIN_... and END_...
    
    This will allow for 2 calls -- one for the interpreter to actually stop
    the program and one to call after interruption, to cause UI changes

    * Fix #164

    Adding this infinity prop is part of an update we do not have yet (ace
    editor) https://github.com/fxmontigny/ng2-ace-editor/issues/11
    
    Used a fix for react I found here: https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace/issues/29
    
    * Fix #172, #171, #168 using PureComponent
    
    - Call scroll inside ReplInput instead of Repl
    - Change components to PureComponents (thereby changing the update
    condition)
    - Remove throttle for onChange
    
    Lack of unneccasry updates and proper scrolling mechanism fixed #168.
    
    * Format files
    
    * Update tests
    
    * Move overflow to side-content-text
    
    Also fixed a minor issue with padding disappearing, using fit-content.
    
    * Remove text justification for markdown editor
    
    I don't think markdown is justified, and so we shouln't be displaying it
    in such a way either.
    
    * Fix always-on scrollbars on X11
    
    * Add overflow-y for card

    I'll remove this to use blueprint icons instead, later on.
    
    * Add typedefs for showdown
    
    * Add GradingEditor component

    * Fix compiler errors
    
    Alphabetisizing, typos.
    
    * Remove undefined union for gradingCommentsValue
    
    The `markdown` value in `mdeState` being undefined causes a runtime
    error. So it is easier to just deal with a definite string (since
    undefined is not allowed anyway). The typedef for the value allows
    undefined though.
    
    * Scaffold link component to render for grid
    
    The problem is that the current <a href> implementation is a hard
    redirect, causing a change in URL (and loss of all state). I'm trying to
    get a NavLink
    
    * Format and de-style NavLink
    
    * Use undefined check
    
    * Force non-null for markdown value
    
    Since it will be set by the default state,
    it is never null.
    
    * Add componentWillMount for grading/index
    
    * Add props for updating ids
    
    * Add action
    
    * Fix buggy componentWillMount functions
    
    Checks only for submissionId, if it is present then there should be a
    questionId as well.

    Scaffold Grading functionality (#151)
    
    * Add react-router props for Grading/index
    
    * Add param checks and component render call
    
    The call for GradingWorkspaceContainer is added, but the
    container/component is not defined yet.
    
    * Add container
    
    * Add scaffolded component
    
    Many todos.
    
    * Format components

    * Add types for Grading and GradingQuestion
    
    * Fix a reference and type error

    The problem was extending both IMCQQuestion and IProgramming question,
    that had clashing properties `type`. Solved this by extending a base
    class.
    
    * Fix exports for GradingWorkspace component
    
    * Fix type error for GradingQuestion instance
    
    Also added a call to actions (to be defined)

    another PR, together with the components itself, that are pretty bulky.
    
    * Add a scaffold grading tab
    
    * Format files
    
    * Simplify logic of rendering loading/grid

    * Add generic type for Context definition
    
    * Rename external to externalContext
    
    * Add typing for createContext & createEmptyContext
    
    * Add externalContext parameter to state
    
    Any instance of createContext() has been given the appropriate
    parameter. As a result, the context has a property that corresponds to
    the location it is in (externalContext === 'assessment' or 'playground')
    
    * Add location parameter to display and timed (WIP)
    
    timed does not work as of yet, as the initial implementation does not
    work in the first place.
    
    * Add working stdlib.timed function
    
    - This does not care about context, and runs the same as map or filter.
    I think this should be changed in the future. Unfortunately, I had
    little reference as all implementations of `timed` failed when I tried
    them (sourceacademy2).
    
    - To make this run, I disabled redux-persist. I shall add what happened
    into the tracked issue. To get this to run, checkout createStore.ts and
    index.tsx from a commit prior to adding the cache (from master).
    
    - I will move timed back into the "infinity" chapter after getting it to
    work.
    
    - Logging does not work as of now.
    
    * Fix logs not showing up
    
    We should find a way to type the action payloads to catch erros like
    these (where we are forced to pass things as untyped objects)

    Segregate Playground and Assessment Workspaces (#137)
    
    * Remove updateEditorValue in workspace/DispatchProp
    
    I will add this back as an OwnProps property, passed by either Assessment or
    Playground
    
    * Rename workspaceSaga to playgroundSaga
    
    * Move actionTypes around
    
    * Move playground actions into workspace/actions
    
    Added an additional parameter to denote the location of the action call.
    
    * Disconnect all workspace components
    
    Due to the workspace's input and dispatch being determined by the
    context, they can be passed in as props by Assessment or Playground.
    
    * Refactor components that call Workspace
    
    * Fill in missing props in Playground and Assessment
    
    Also fixed some errors picked up at compilation time.
    
    * Pass in SideContentProps instead of tabs
    
    * Add location to saga calls
    
    * Fix more errors
    
    For some reason the member-ordering linting does not pass despite
    proper(?) ordering. I'll open an issue for this.
    
    * Modify default values for ControlBar
    
    * Add WorkspaceManager state
    
    This holds the 2 instances of IWorkspaceState, playground and
    assessment. I've also added a scaffold of how the reducer function would
    work, given a location. The location (type WorkspaceLocation) is now
    specified to correspond to the key of the IWorkspaceState within the
    IWorkspaceManagerState.
    
    * Add location for reducer cases
    
    Also made some interpreter actions to include location
    
    * Fix PlaygroundContainer's IState reference
    
    - Removed cached editorValue
    - Renamed IState.workspace into workspaces
    - Fixed a typo
    
    * Add location to sagas
    
    * Fix reducer naming error
    
    * Rename workspace file to workspaces
    
    * Add MapDispatchToProps call and DispatchProps
    
    * Add dispatch and state references to container
    
    * Use dispatch props in Playground component
    
    Also added a missing handleChangeActiveTab
    
    * Fix sideContentHeight not being stored in state
    
    * Remove buggy currying function
    
    For some reason, the spread and rest operators did not work with the
    varying argument lengths. I proceeded to change them to a manual
    currying. Also fixed a bug with the argument type for
    handleEditorWidthChange.
    
    * Fix property bug with evaluation
    
    * Add state and dispatch for Assessment
    
    * Sepatate Contexts for playground and assessment
    
    * Format and Update test snapshots
    
    * Use more elegant enums
    
    * Sort properties
    
    * Update test because of sorting
    
    * Use editorValue in Assessment
    
    * Make editorValue possibly undefined
    
    This allows the "presetting" of values like in the case of a
    solutionTemplate. However, it also forces any component to provide such
    a value, thus I have added a template string for playground.
    
    * Add .env to gitignore
    
    * Add aciton to reset assessment workspace
    
    * Add state slice for tracking assessment/question
    
    * Format Assessment component
    
    * Add comopnent props to get the current Assessment
    
    * Add update method for current assessment
    
    * Clean up logic for updating
    
    * Fix logical errors preventing store changes
    
    - For IStateProps, the properties I was assigning to were optional,
    meaning that the linting did not catch the error. I overcame this by
    storing and casting the return value.
    - Made a mistake in using es6 object literal notation in the reducer, as
    the property name was not as expected.
    
    * Format and update tests

    In line with the naming in the state and reducer.
    
    * Fix playground default text bug
    
    * Format some files

    * Fix links making playground uneditable
    
    The parsed program is now updated only once, when the page loads, rather
    than when the component is updated.
    
    * Revert "Fix links making playground uneditable"
    
    This reverts commit 599db0f6c5e0673d704707aca92743439d369951.
    
    * Standardize parameters for workspace
    
    Now, we can pass in only a value and an optional library number.
    This allows the Playground to handle parsing of the library program. If
    there is a program passed in via the hash, the parsed program will be
    passed. If not, the parsed program will be undefind, causing the redux
    store value to be passed (using the `||` operator).

    Add deploy to staging with terraform (#120)
    
    * Add terraform and deployment scripts
    
    * Hotfix errors due to minifying js assets
    
    1. It seems that using shorthand generator function definitions in objects (for
       src/slang/interpreter.ts) will result in a minified file where the generator
       method replaced by a function. `yield` calls in this generator therefore
       raise an uncaught syntax error in the browser. See:
       https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7566
    2. A known issue with causes reuse of const variables in the same scope. See:
       https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/2842
    
    * Fix workspace-green css
    
    * Add profile variable to terraform config
    
    * Fix runInContext not finishing in minified js
    
    * Fix more instances of method shorthand bugs

    Add mock Assessment API calls (#113)
    
    Resolves #74
    
    * Add /missions result
    
    * Add closed and all missions
    
    Also added a counter for all the ids
    
    * Add mock questions
    
    * Make assessment folder
    
    * Add types and interfaces for assessment api calls
    
    * Match mock data to updated fields
    
    - Only closed assessment previews available (2 of them)
    - 3 open assessment previews
    - Changed dates to string
    
    * Make Questions use inheritence
    
    The union of interfaces seems to work.
    
    * Use IAssessment in Assessment component
    
    * Change dispatch name in component
    
    * Use proper variable names in AssessmentContainer
    
    * Change state to use IAssessment
    
    Also:
    - Used `Array<T>` for definition in mock api
    - Formatted AssessmentContainer
    
    * Use IAssessmentOverview in academy/missions
    
    Also removed category-specific assessments
    
    * Use IAssessmentOverview for Missions
    
    Also added an enum for AssessmentCategory
    
    * Fix mission tests
    
    * Use assessment-related names in MissionsContainer
    
    * Modify state to use IAssessmentOverview
    
    * Modify mission info fetch action to assessment
    
    * Fix linting and tests
    
    * Fix filtering issue for missions
    
    The problem was with a faulty dataset.Also added
    - Fix for not showing "loading" page (which was a mistake I made a few
    commits ago)
    - Spacing out for contentdisplay cards
    
    * Use enum category values
    
    * Arrange fields in alphabetical order
    
    * Format mockAPI
    
    * Make fetchAssessmentOverviews general
    
    This is because the API fetch is to fetch all the previews. Having the
    parameter for category there, but not using it (or using it, resulting
    in multiple calls for multiple categories) is not preferred.
    
    * Add saga for assessment overview fetching
    
    Note that the initial data is still not removed.
    
    * Add mock API fetch for assessment overviews
    
    The default value for the overviews is now undefined so as to
    simulate the fetching.
    
    * Format some files
    
    * Add API call for fetching assessment
    
    Moved the fetch dispact in the academy/mission component from the render
    function to the componentWillMount function, as we should not render
    (due to content updates) while the render function is running.
    
    * Format and update test files
    
    * Add historyHelper to state
    
    It got lost somewhere in the rebase
    
    * Use typed Map instead of Object for IAssessments

    Scaffold assessment (#100)
    
    * Move StateProps and DispatchProps to component
    
    By our convention
    
    Add scaffold files for Assessment
    
    - Container
    - Component
    - Actions
    - State slice
    
    No functionality is added in this commit
    
    * Add a workspace using routing
    
    Apologies for the large commit, didn't feel like I should do a
    no-verify.
    
    - Fixed usage of OwnProps
    - state/session/assessmentInfos is an empty array by default, not
    undefined. This is to allow fetching of individual missions (and access
    by index)
    - Use of local state for the briefing Dialog
    - Parse a routing parameter missionId (thereby making IMissionsProps
    extend RouteComponentProps)
    
    Fix typo
    
    Fix assessment dispatch calls
    
    - Add paramteter to handleAssessmentInfoFetch
    - Remove call to handleBriefStudentbriefStudent
    
    Remove briefStudent
    
    * Make assessment's workspace instance dark
    
    Now, it visually looks the same as the Playground's one.
    - Used pt-dark in Assessment
    - Added CSS for Assessment
    - Shifted workspace background color into workspace css
    - Moved a padding property for the workspace into workspace (from
    playground)
    
    * Add Link for MissionInfo Cards
    
    - Added the missionId as part of the missionInfo state
    - I added a MemoryRouter in the tests, as creating a `Route` outside
    a `Router` is prohibited (as we are not using a `Switch` for this case,
    so that we can hanlde the parameter type conversion as early as
    possible.
    
    No Verify due to changing stack size for slang infinite recursion.
    
    Fix test linting errors
    
    * Pass in props to workspace
    
    - Moved OwnProps to container (Addresses #104 WorkspaceContainer)
    - Shifted some imports
    
    * Use OwnProps in ControlBarContainer
    
    - Removed duplicate properties in Workspace's StateProps
    - Used OwnProps in the component as well (see #104)
    
    * Make assessment loading readable
    
    - Added a second mission, to load an unfetched mission
    
    * Make briefing look better
    
    * Add string interpolation
    
    * Change level of abstraction for Assessment
    
    * Add Text tag for briefing
    
    * Fix a singular typo
    
    * Add a singular line break
    
    * Remove OwnProps for Assessment and Workspace
    
    * Remove OwnProps for side content

    Make NavigationBars Responsive (#93)
    
    * Abstract Navbar style
    
    Into primary and secondary navbars. With this, Admin also shares the
    same look as the academy navbar.
    
    REBASE: Used the extension implemented in Change-UX.
    
    * Make Application NavBar responsive
    
    - Added a dependency: flexboxgrid-helpers (for the hidden classes, which
    were not added to the original flexboxgrid due to no maintainence. We
    could attempt changing our flexboxgrid dependency to flexboxgrid2, which
    is a fork of the original.)
    - Added a css class to make NavbarDivider thinner on small displays.
    - Icon names are hidden on xs devices (having the chrome window half
    size, or using a phone)
    
    REBASE: Used the undefined checking in Change-UX
    
    * Fix margin on navbar buttons
    
    Added some documentation for the navbar scss as well.
    
    * Make academy navbar responsive
    
    REBASE: Removed game button
    
    * Make admin navbar responsive

    * Make sideContent bottom flush with editor bottom
    
    * Add snapping for Editor's parent Resizable
    
    - Renamed dividerDiv to sideDividerDiv for verbosity
    
    * Add a divider to make a margin for the right side
    
    when the width is < 5%. The left margins in the right-parent children
    (in `pt-card`s) were removed, and the new div editorDividerDiv acts as
    the "margin" when the editor resizable is snapped to the left (0%). When
    not snapped, there is a right margin on the whole left-parent to space it
    from the right-parent.

    Change UX structure (#85)
    
    * Move button to desired structure
    
    This is purely a visual change. The actual structure is to be changed
    
    * Add fixed snapshot
    
    * Fix links from device --> academy
    
    * Move Announcements out of device
    
    * Add username display in place of 'Profile'
    
    * Change all instances of device -> academy

    * Fix alignment for mission card due date
    
    * Move Game button into Academy
    
    In order to fix a problem with the `object-contain` property for Game, I
    added a display:flex property to Academy to allow the Game to take up as
    much width as possible (`flex 1 1`) while allowing the academy navbar to
    stay in its initial height. To be verbose, one could set flex:initial in
    the navbar as well.
    
    * Move Game files into academy
    
    - Changed tslint exception directory
    - Changed relative utils dependency directory
    
    * Hide profile button if not logged in
    
    * Remove Game button
    
    * Change url /announcements -> /news
    
    * Fix admin navbar not being thin

    Add game (#82)
    
    * Add an empty component for the game
    
    * Copy over source-academy2's story-xml as story
    
    * Produce a blank canvas in the Game component
    
    The latest version of pixi was used, because I could only get the
    typedefs for 4.7.X. A blank canvas is produced but the story is not
    loaded onto it (no attempt was made).
    
    There was a webpack error when I used the older version of pixi, probably due to the discepency between the
    typedef and the actual exports.
    
    No verify.
    
    * Make story javascript runnable
    
    What remains is to pass in the right data to the assets server to get
    the story assets.
    
    * Add mock game data, TweenMax CDN
    
    * Add pixi libraries as local scripts
    
    Couldn't find any node packages that fit the version requirements.
    
    * Add scss for the game
    
    * Remove pixi <script> tags
    
    * Add es6 imports for PIXI in story/
    
    Also moved the pixi.js module from devDependencies to dependencies
    
    * Change exports to es6, got Loading... screen
    
    * Fix implicit declarations, got hallway to render
    
    * Fix crash due to pixi-filter's GlowFliters
    
    The GlowFilter constructor from v3 took 7 arguments, but the v4 variant only
    takes 5. Removed the first two (height, width). This fixes the runtime error,
    but causes the animation for GlowFilter to bug out.
    
    - When an animated object implementing the GlowFilter filter is hovered over,
      (and presumably, the GlowFilter is applied), the animated object will
      'teleport' to the top-left.
    
    * Fix animation obj with glow not rendering
    
    * Fix dialog text causing runtime error
    
    The story's dialog-manager was depending on an undocumented method wordWrap from
    version 3 of pixi, that was not ported over to version 4. Fixed by extending
    v4's PIXI.text to include this method.
    
    * Make game canvas resize relative to browser
    
    * Relocate pixi story stuff under components
    
    * Remove 1/3 jquery calls with react element ref
    
    * Resolve pixi deprecation warnings
    
    * Make game state
    
    * Fix game not working on second render onwards
    
    * Update redirects in the game
    
    1. Update URLs within source academy
    2. Make redirects react-friendly
    
    * Fix typo in comment

    Abstract content components (#79)
    
    * Add ContentDisplay component
    
    * Make default state one line
    
    * Abstract Announcements by using ContentDisplay
    
    To do this, the ContentDisplay is rendered inside Announcements, passing
    it props.
    - Handling content being undefined (and showing a spinner) is handled by
    the display SFC (in this case, AnnouncementCard). As such,
    - The `contentLoaded` property of IContentDisplayProps was removed
    - Respective test was updated.
    
    * Change erroneous Announcement style in ContentDisplay
    
    * Change display from a function to a JSX element
    
    This is because there is no dependency on the values being `undefined`
    anymore, as the burden of checking lies with the displayed component
    itself e.g AnnouncementCard checking for undefined announcements.
    
    In the future, if there is a need for lazy loading of displays, this can
    be reimplemented.
    
    * Add basic test for ContentDisplay
    
    * Move ContentDisplay to a components/commons
    
    This is because it is a commonly used component, that shall be used by
    Materials as well.

    Organise utilities (#59)
    
    * Move registerServiceWorker, notification to utils
    
    - utils is a new directory under ./src/ holding misc modules that don't seem to
      fit anywhere else.
    - createStore was excluded from utils since the store is a core part of our
      react/redux app, and so it does make sense as a standalone module in the root
      ./src/ directory
    - Also fixed #37 unnecessary yield undefined.
    
    * Rename 'genericButton' -> 'controlButton'
    
    Also avoided variable name negation by renaming its argument 'notMinimal' ->
    'minimal'. Refactor ReplControl to list declarations in decreasing levels of
    abstraction.
    
    (addresses review in PR #35)

    Make REPL scroll down on I/O change (#67)
    
    * Add componentUpdate function to scroll down
    
    * Fix glitchiness of output when updating Repl
    
    I believe that this is due to trying to scroll and update the component
    at the same time, causing glitches (such as half the output being
    rendered, followed by the other half in 0.2s). I solved this using a
    slightly hacky solution -- to wait for a very short period before
    scrolling. Ideally, I would like to use a React method that is called
    *after* updating.
    
    * Revert "Fix glitchiness of output when updating Repl"
    
    This reverts commit 6c8bc347ce6d7ec92c258c00a9a0a496f5786ec3.
    Using setTimeOut caused an error where, given fast input and output, the

    token is an optional string property of the new slice of the state, session.
    token represents an API token returned by the cadet backend. If there is no

    token is a placeholder property.

    * Connect session.token to Login instead of Device
    
    I'm planning on also requiring log in to access the game. In that case, both
    device and game will call the log in dialog. Then, it makes more sense to
    connect state.session.token to log in once, rather than twice to device and
    game.

    Improve test coverage for slang's rttc (#45)
    
    1. Had to make changes to src/mocks/context.ts in order to for the mock Closure
       to use the Closure constructor (our own typeOf uses typeof, which checks the
       constructor to determine object types).
    2. To get 100% test coverage, there was a need to call the elaborate method of
       TypeError. Went ahead and replaced that with explain() since it's probably
       better than 'TODO'.
    3. Best way to test the error messages was with snapshots, IMO.
    
    Resolves #38.
    
    * Fix typing
    
    Typescript thinks that errors could possible be undefined.
    
    * Add tests for valid binary <, >, <=, >=
    
    Also fixed the test title ('<==|>==' -> '<=|>=')

    Redesign IDE (#21)
    
    * Add button for playground at Navbar
    
    No functionality.
    
    * Make first NavbarGroup's align left explicit
    
    * Change playground icon
    
    * Add routes to Playground
    
    * Update test snapshots
    
    * Fix bad test for Playground component
    
    Oops
    
    * Add react-ace for IDE
    
    * Try passing props into playground
    
    * Load a preset "Hello World" onto the ace editor.
    
    Changes:
    - Changed `Playground` component to a statefull one (extends `React.Component)
    - add property `playgroundCode` to IApplicationState (bad practice,
    change to a slice of the state instead)
    - add interface `IPlaygroundProps` to denote the properties passed to
    Playground
    
    * Remove unused onChange()
    
    * Add stored state for playground editor text
    
    Once again, this is a WIP. Text typed into the playground editor will
    stay in the playground (or rather, appear again) after leaving and
    coming back.
    
    Changes:
    - added of action, actionCreator (updatePlaygroundCode)
    - added a reducer under application's `reducer` function
    
    Possible problems:
    - Location of reducer
    - Location of playgroundCode stored (as in previous commit)
    
    * Change initialValue prop to editorValue
    
    * Made playground actions a separate file
    
    * Modify actions and dispatch call
    
    * Change redux import statement
    
    * Add IPlaygroundState to IState in index reducer
    
    * Add playground reducer
    
    * Remove playgroundCode from IApplicationState
    
    * Fix type errors
    
    Made a compromise by including an IPlaygroundState as part of IApplicationProps
    
    * Re-disable console.logs (tslint)
    
    * Fix missing imports for react-ace mode, theme
    
    * Add playground CSS
    
    * Add JSDoc style comments for playground
    
    * Fix some tests
    
    * Fix semantics of mapStateToProps for ApplicationContainer
    
    * Do trivial formatting
    
    * Add interpreter toolchain as 'slang'
    
    This is a copy over of the current state of `./frontend/src/toolchain` at
    source-academy/source-academy2 67d9184. It includes only source chapter 1, a new
    specification (see [PR 6 at the
    source-academy/source-academy2](https://github.com/source-academy/source-academy2/pull/6)
    repository).
    
    * Add react-saga and react types to yarn
    
    The react types were added as a result of the `yarn add` command.
    
    * Add saga to middleware list
    
    * Segregate actionTypes from actions
    
    * Fix reducer actionType import
    
    * Remove actionType import from action/index
    
    * Fix fatal bug with defineVariable calls
    
    * Fix missing imports
    
    Some imports of slang are already provided as additional dependencies to other
    modules, e.g. acorn is already a dependency of webpack
    
    * Add tests for slang
    
    * Remove unused type definitions
    
    * Lint typescript files of slang
    
    * Add interruption actionType
    
    * Add sagas WIP
    
    For ny's reference
    
    * Add more interpreter actions
    
    * Change to older version of saga
    
    * Add notification file
    
    * Change es target to es2016
    
    This was the target in sourceacademy-2 as well. Without this, there was
    a problem with casting an `IterableIterator` to `yield*`, that expected
    an array.
    
    * Revert "Remove unused type definitions"
    
    This reverts commit e18f2ae3e1bd86380cc12285652ac204d01e6f65.
    "Oops" - @ningyuansg
    
    * Fix some slang errors
    
    * Make 16/05 code review changes
    
    Changes not made:
    - Change of `Playground` component to an `SFC`
    
    * Fix test snapshot (name of onChange for ReactAce)
    
    Due to 7ac707c.
    
    * Revert Playground as SFC, make Editor container
    
    * Make Playground stateless
    
    This is done by abstracting out the ace editor into its own component
    , `Editor`, and its own container to handle redux calls,
    `EditorContainer`.
    
    * Add test and fix export type
    
    Export of `Editor` changed to a default export, like the other
    components. A test has been added for the `Editor` component. Snapshot
    changes pending.
    
    * Fix type errors according to tslint
    
    * Change object methods to use es6 shorthand
    
    * Fix more linting errors for interpreter.ts
    
    * Disable `no-empty` rule.
    
    Rationale: A no-op function is much easier to see as `() => {}` as
    compared to `() => undefined` or even `() =>`. In addition, this syntax
    is used by parts of the interpreter as well.
    
    * Add `max-classes-per-file` exception for interpreter files
    
    Splitting the exports would cause futher refactoring in other parts of
    the interpreter codebase
    
    * Fix linting errors in parser, rules/braces...
    
    * Fix tslint errors in `parser`
    
    Exception was added for multiple class exports.
    
    * Format interpreter.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors in rules/*
    
    * Fix tslint errors for rttc.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for node.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for types.ts
    
    * Fix stdlib/list, stdlib/misc and scheudler tslint
    
    An additional change is the use of a line disable in `parser.ts` instead
    of an entire file disable.
    
    * Fix `saga` not being run after store creation
    
    * Fix Editor test (tslint errors)
    
    1. Missing comma in object props
    2. Syntax error and missing object comprehension in creating Editor
    
    * Add properties context, output to IPlaygroundState
    
    1. context is of type slang.Context. This holds the 'environment' for the slang
       interpreter
    2. Output is a string array that will hold the stdout/stderr (display, error
       calls) of a program run in the editor. For repl programs, it will also hold
       the return value of the program. Each element of an array is a historical
       output.
    
    * Add button to call on handleEvalEditor
    
    This change allows the newly added button to call upon the
    handleEvalEditor callback, whose reducer is not defined (yet)
    
    * Add mapDispatchToProps for EditorContainer
    
    Note that the intersection type is used with `Pick<T>` in order to
    define `DispatchProps`, this might not be ideal. Input on this issue
    would be appreciated.
    
    * Fix 'ace is undefined' error
    
    * Add Output SFC
    
    * Add output tests, did yarn format
    
    * Add 'run' button to EditorContainer
    
    * Change Editor snapshot to include button
    
    * Wire saga interpreter success to output SFC
    
    * Fix wrong file extension '.tsx' -> '.ts'
    
    'Oops' - ny
    
    * Move state definitions into their own file
    
    Fixes #7
    
    * Add type for interpreter outputs
    
    In addition, tslint rule `interface-over-type-literal` was disabled, due to the need
    for many types (that would not be extended)
    
    * Fix #11, using bindActionCreators
    
    * Add flexboxgrid dependency
    
    * Line Editor and Output up side to side
    
    * Refactor and modularise playground as IDE
    
    * Change Output to Repl
    
    This is to allow for the incoming repl, which will produce outputs as
    well.
    
    * Implement multiple Outputs in Repl (history)
    
    * Fix class playground not taking up all of parent
    
    * Make use of slang's toString to format values
    
    Previously, undefined would print as '' (empty string).
    
    * Make flexbox tags relative to current component
    
    * Make IPlaygroundState properties readonly
    
    Fixes #14
    
    * Add ReplInput (not wired to saga)
    
    * Replace TextArea with AceEditor
    
    Also change theme to dark background so we can debug better.
    
    * Move IDE buton to a separate Control component
    
    This is contained within the IDE component
    
    * Add property replValue to IPlaygroundState
    
    replValue, like editorValue, will store the contents of repl. It is used to
    allow the contents of the repl to persist through route changes. It is also the
    target for evaluation.
    
    * Make repl read from state.playground.replValue
    
    * Add evalRepl
    
    * Update Control snapshot with eval button
    
    * Add action UPDATE_REPL_VALUE
    
    * Implement persistent repl content across routes
    
    * Did yarn format
    
    * Add action clear repl
    
    Also removed unnecessarily verbose typings
    
    * Make eval button clear the replValue
    
    * Fix repl context resetting every eval
    
    TODO: Editor run needs to update playground context
    
    * Add keyboard shortcut for REPL
    
    * Fix formatting for repl shortcut
    
    * Errors are loosely represented as string 'error'
    
    * Fix yarn format git hooks passing for unformatted
    
    Previously, if the staged files are not formatted according to prettier, running
    the pre-commit hook would change the file formatting, and then return an exit
    code 0, allowing the commit to go through. However, the changes made by prettier
    are not staged.
    
    Now, the pre-commit hook will fail, so that only prettier-passed files can be
    committed.
    
    * Add ParseError in slang
    
    * Improve error messages to specify type of error
    
    * Improve CSS for repl output
    
    * Fix many error messages not printing on new lines
    
    Thank you stackoverflow
    
    * Fix editor not changing playground.context
    
    * Change ParseError to a function, parseError
    
    * Simplify REPL Output Component creation
    
    Turns out there's a 2-arity `map` that provides index
    
    * Rename playground css to ide
    
    * Change Playground to IDE in ide.css
    
    No visible change in effect. Regardless, this will probably be
    refactored once SCSS is introduced
    
    * Change "ClEAR_REPL" to "CLEAR_REPL_INPUT"
    
    This is to differenciate between the clearing of repl input and output
    
    * Add button and actions to clear REPL output
    
    - Button added
    - Action and reducer added
    
    * Make the clear button wipe the REPL context
    
    * Revert "Make clear button wipe the REPL context"
    
    I realised that source academy does not clear the context, and that
    clearing only the output is in line with most command-line applications
    and REPLs.
    This reverts commit 4bd3c443ae0b6fc45db5bae830254ca3037ac1fa.
    
    * Remove duplicate EditorContainer
    
    Was received from merging master into the branch
    
    * Fix button row in playground overflowing to right
    
    Would cause tiny bit of empty space on the right of the page, slightly outside
    the viewport.
    
    * Fix padding issues with ReplInput
    
    * Remove the Playground title
    
    * Increase font size of ace-editor (12 -> 14)
    
    * Make IDE content responsive with viewport height
    
    * Replace css with scss
    
    Resolves #5.
    
    * Make all the stuff partials
    
    * Fix playground width being tied to viewport height
    
    * Fix playground overflowing out of viewport
    
    * Make .pt-card child of .Repl
    
    * Make Repl scrollable
    
    * Make run button clearReplOutput, remove default
    
    * Add dark theme for Application
    
    This includes a dark background, and adding the `pt-dark` class to
    enable dark themes for all Blueprint components. Note that a relative
    path to blueprint was used for the background color, to be changed in
    the next commit.
    
    * Output code typed in ReplInput as Output
    
    * Use array method concat, reorder definitions
    
    Readability changes.
    
    * Change import for scss file in node_modules
    
    This is becase ["The `~` notation is webpack-specific"](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2859) and we should use `node_modules` to refer to the sass file instead.
    
    * Rename IDE/Control to IDE/ReplControl
    
    Skipped checks
    
    * Change internals of ReplControl
    
    from the names and functionality of `Control` to `ReplControl`.
    Skipped checks
    
    * Add ReplControlContainer to main Repl component
    
    * Add run button to IDE/Editor
    
    * Fix layout and tests
    
    * No verify commit, tests fails
    
    * Fix failing tests
    
    Okay, so slang's display needs access to the store in order to call dispatch, so
    that the display can be output'd in realtime. In the previous commit, this was
    achieved by importing the instantiated store from src/index.tsx into
    src/slang/stdlib/misc.ts.
    
    This works when the full server is running, but fails with the tests, because
    mockContext calls createContext, which imports stdlib/misc, which tries to
    import store. But because it's just a test, and store doesn't exist, the test
    fails.
    
    * Make run button interrupt execution
    
    * Make eval interrupt execution, remove notifs
    
    Next, change display so that if playground.output array is empty, initialise.
    
    * Fix display not working after a clear
    
    * Make buttons minimal
    
    * Fix Eval button crashing site when Output[] empty
    
    This is because the Output SFC tries to access an undefined output.consoleLogs.
    
    output.consoleLogs is undefined after an Eval button click, because
    EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) will try to access the last element of
    playground.outputs, but the last element after playground.outputs is always a
    CodeOutput for Eval button presses; and CodeOutput doesn't have a consoleLogs
    property, so EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) copies over undefined as the new
    ResultOutput or ErrorOutput's consoleLog property.
    
    * Refactor display interactions with react/redux
    
    * Fix react-ace editor overflowing
    
    * Fix Application not taking up full height
    
    * Make REPL input same length as output cards
    
    * Increment repl input min line
    
    * Change react-ace theme
    
    * Change background and navbar colors
    
    * Make margin changes
    
    * Make IDE and background colors more consistent
    
    * Add color palette
    
    * Nest all output in code tags
    
    * Use new colors in cards
    
    * Decrease minLines to 1
    
    * Fix alignment for button groups
    
    * Add editor border radius
    
    * Remove faint border around code tags
    
    * Make REPL scroll only Outputs, not buttons
    
    * Fix firefox overflow issue with REPL
    
    * Add different colours for each output type
    
    * Make editor parent Resizable
    
    * Fix repl input being hidden
    
    This probably caused by not using `col-number-xs` for the repl-parent anymore,
    due to the resizing.
    
    * Align REPL input with editor bottom
    
    * Re-add fix for Firefox
    
    * Disable resize for directions other than right
    
    * Add persistent state for resizable editor width
    
    Note that handleEditorChange has been modified to
    handleEditorValueChange, to be clearer when comapring to
    handleEditorWidthChange.
    
    * Fix white color when scrolling beyond page
    
    * Put eval, clear buttons in control group
    
    * Fix repl output not wrapping
    
    * Make IDE component contain Resizable
    
    Note that this make the IDE/index component stateful, handling the
    editor width.
    
    * Change editorWidth to percentage
    
    This means that the change in width (in pixels) would need to be
    converted to a percentage change (in the component) and the string must
    be converted, added to the percentage change, then parsed again. A
    possble optimization is keeping the number as a float (which would
    involve one parse when passing it as a prop). However, I find it
    semantically cleaner to keep the `editorWidth` as a string that expresses
    a percentage, as compared to an `editorWidthPercentage` that holds a
    number.
    
    * Remove duplicate Editor
    
    * Move run button to the left
    
    * Add maxWidth for Resizable editor-parent
    
    This is set to be the same as the default minWidth, 10px.
    
    * Modify updateEditorWidth to changeEditorWidth
    
    * Fix extra space between 2 pre elements
    
    * Add in library select button
    
    Missed it out in the previous merge commit, as I deleted the IDE/Control component #oops
    
    * Add minor format change

    Restrict `If`, ternary conditions to booleans (#40)
    
    * Add button for playground at Navbar
    
    No functionality.
    
    * Make first NavbarGroup's align left explicit
    
    * Change playground icon
    
    * Add routes to Playground
    
    * Update test snapshots
    
    * Fix bad test for Playground component
    
    Oops
    
    * Add react-ace for IDE
    
    * Try passing props into playground
    
    * Load a preset "Hello World" onto the ace editor.
    
    Changes:
    - Changed `Playground` component to a statefull one (extends `React.Component)
    - add property `playgroundCode` to IApplicationState (bad practice,
    change to a slice of the state instead)
    - add interface `IPlaygroundProps` to denote the properties passed to
    Playground
    
    * Remove unused onChange()
    
    * Add stored state for playground editor text
    
    Once again, this is a WIP. Text typed into the playground editor will
    stay in the playground (or rather, appear again) after leaving and
    coming back.
    
    Changes:
    - added of action, actionCreator (updatePlaygroundCode)
    - added a reducer under application's `reducer` function
    
    Possible problems:
    - Location of reducer
    - Location of playgroundCode stored (as in previous commit)
    
    * Change initialValue prop to editorValue
    
    * Made playground actions a separate file
    
    * Modify actions and dispatch call
    
    * Change redux import statement
    
    * Add IPlaygroundState to IState in index reducer
    
    * Add playground reducer
    
    * Remove playgroundCode from IApplicationState
    
    * Fix type errors
    
    Made a compromise by including an IPlaygroundState as part of IApplicationProps
    
    * Re-disable console.logs (tslint)
    
    * Fix missing imports for react-ace mode, theme

    for many types (that would not be extended)
    
    * Fix #11, using bindActionCreators
    
    * Add flexboxgrid dependency
    
    * Line Editor and Output up side to side
    
    * Refactor and modularise playground as IDE
    
    * Change Output to Repl
    
    This is to allow for the incoming repl, which will produce outputs as
    well.
    
    * Implement multiple Outputs in Repl (history)
    
    * Fix class playground not taking up all of parent
    
    * Make use of slang's toString to format values
    
    Previously, undefined would print as '' (empty string).
    
    * Make flexbox tags relative to current component
    
    * Make IPlaygroundState properties readonly
    
    Fixes #14
    
    * Add ReplInput (not wired to saga)
    
    * Replace TextArea with AceEditor
    
    Also change theme to dark background so we can debug better.
    
    * Move IDE buton to a separate Control component
    
    This is contained within the IDE component
    
    * Add property replValue to IPlaygroundState
    
    replValue, like editorValue, will store the contents of repl. It is used to
    allow the contents of the repl to persist through route changes. It is also the
    target for evaluation.
    
    * Make repl read from state.playground.replValue
    
    * Add evalRepl
    
    * Update Control snapshot with eval button
    
    * Add action UPDATE_REPL_VALUE
    
    * Implement persistent repl content across routes
    
    * Did yarn format
    
    * Add action clear repl
    
    Also removed unnecessarily verbose typings
    
    * Make eval button clear the replValue
    
    * Fix repl context resetting every eval
    
    TODO: Editor run needs to update playground context
    
    * Add keyboard shortcut for REPL
    
    * Fix formatting for repl shortcut
    
    * Errors are loosely represented as string 'error'
    
    * Fix yarn format git hooks passing for unformatted
    
    Previously, if the staged files are not formatted according to prettier, running
    the pre-commit hook would change the file formatting, and then return an exit
    code 0, allowing the commit to go through. However, the changes made by prettier
    are not staged.
    
    Now, the pre-commit hook will fail, so that only prettier-passed files can be
    committed.
    
    * Add ParseError in slang
    
    * Improve error messages to specify type of error
    
    * Improve CSS for repl output
    
    * Fix many error messages not printing on new lines
    
    Thank you stackoverflow
    
    * Fix editor not changing playground.context
    
    * Change ParseError to a function, parseError
    
    * Simplify REPL Output Component creation
    
    Turns out there's a 2-arity `map` that provides index
    
    * Rename playground css to ide
    
    * Change Playground to IDE in ide.css
    
    No visible change in effect. Regardless, this will probably be
    refactored once SCSS is introduced
    
    * Change "ClEAR_REPL" to "CLEAR_REPL_INPUT"
    
    This is to differenciate between the clearing of repl input and output
    
    * Add button and actions to clear REPL output
    
    - Button added
    - Action and reducer added
    
    * Make the clear button wipe the REPL context
    
    * Revert "Make clear button wipe the REPL context"
    
    I realised that source academy does not clear the context, and that
    clearing only the output is in line with most command-line applications
    and REPLs.
    This reverts commit 4bd3c443ae0b6fc45db5bae830254ca3037ac1fa.
    
    * Remove duplicate EditorContainer
    
    Was received from merging master into the branch
    
    * Fix button row in playground overflowing to right
    
    Would cause tiny bit of empty space on the right of the page, slightly outside
    the viewport.
    
    * Make run button clearReplOutput, remove default
    
    * Output code typed in ReplInput as Output
    
    * Use array method concat, reorder definitions
    
    Readability changes.
    
    * No verify commit, tests fails
    
    * Fix failing tests
    
    Okay, so slang's display needs access to the store in order to call dispatch, so
    that the display can be output'd in realtime. In the previous commit, this was
    achieved by importing the instantiated store from src/index.tsx into
    src/slang/stdlib/misc.ts.
    
    This works when the full server is running, but fails with the tests, because
    mockContext calls createContext, which imports stdlib/misc, which tries to
    import store. But because it's just a test, and store doesn't exist, the test
    fails.
    
    * Make run button interrupt execution
    
    * Make eval interrupt execution, remove notifs
    
    Next, change display so that if playground.output array is empty, initialise.
    
    * Fix display not working after a clear
    
    * Fix Eval button crashing site when Output[] empty
    
    This is because the Output SFC tries to access an undefined output.consoleLogs.
    
    output.consoleLogs is undefined after an Eval button click, because
    EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) will try to access the last element of
    playground.outputs, but the last element after playground.outputs is always a
    CodeOutput for Eval button presses; and CodeOutput doesn't have a consoleLogs
    property, so EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) copies over undefined as the new
    ResultOutput or ErrorOutput's consoleLog property.
    
    * Refactor display interactions with react/redux
    
    * Make RTTC errors fatal, add checks for unary
    
    RTTC errors (type errors found at runtime) will now interrupt execution of the
    program and return an error immediately.
    
    Checks for unary expression arguments have been implemented.
    
    * Update type rules for binary operators
    
    Function type checks not yet implemented
    
    * Fix typings not working for functions
    
    * Fix typings for logical expressions
    
    * Fix number + number raising error
    
    * Fix number (<|<=|>|>=) number raising error
    
    * Add tests, fix some errors with + operator
    
    * Restrict ternary and If conditions to booleans
    
    * Add tests

    Fix typing for Binary, Unary, and Logical Expressions (#24)
    
    * Add button for playground at Navbar
    
    No functionality.
    
    * Make first NavbarGroup's align left explicit
    
    * Change playground icon
    
    * Add routes to Playground
    
    * Update test snapshots
    
    * Fix bad test for Playground component
    
    Oops
    
    * Add react-ace for IDE
    
    * Try passing props into playground
    
    * Load a preset "Hello World" onto the ace editor.
    
    Changes:
    - Changed `Playground` component to a statefull one (extends `React.Component)
    - add property `playgroundCode` to IApplicationState (bad practice,
    change to a slice of the state instead)
    - add interface `IPlaygroundProps` to denote the properties passed to
    Playground
    
    * Remove unused onChange()
    
    * Add stored state for playground editor text
    
    Once again, this is a WIP. Text typed into the playground editor will
    stay in the playground (or rather, appear again) after leaving and
    coming back.
    
    Changes:
    - added of action, actionCreator (updatePlaygroundCode)
    - added a reducer under application's `reducer` function
    
    Possible problems:
    - Location of reducer
    - Location of playgroundCode stored (as in previous commit)
    
    * Change initialValue prop to editorValue
    
    * Made playground actions a separate file
    
    * Modify actions and dispatch call
    
    * Change redux import statement
    
    * Add IPlaygroundState to IState in index reducer
    
    * Add playground reducer
    
    * Remove playgroundCode from IApplicationState
    
    * Fix type errors
    
    Made a compromise by including an IPlaygroundState as part of IApplicationProps
    
    * Re-disable console.logs (tslint)
    
    * Fix missing imports for react-ace mode, theme
    
    * Add playground CSS
    
    * Add JSDoc style comments for playground
    
    * Fix some tests
    
    * Fix semantics of mapStateToProps for ApplicationContainer
    
    * Do trivial formatting
    
    * Add interpreter toolchain as 'slang'
    
    This is a copy over of the current state of `./frontend/src/toolchain` at
    source-academy/source-academy2 67d9184. It includes only source chapter 1, a new
    specification (see [PR 6 at the
    source-academy/source-academy2](https://github.com/source-academy/source-academy2/pull/6)
    repository).
    
    * Add react-saga and react types to yarn
    
    The react types were added as a result of the `yarn add` command.
    
    * Add saga to middleware list
    
    * Segregate actionTypes from actions
    
    * Fix reducer actionType import
    
    * Remove actionType import from action/index
    
    * Fix fatal bug with defineVariable calls
    
    * Fix missing imports
    
    Some imports of slang are already provided as additional dependencies to other
    modules, e.g. acorn is already a dependency of webpack
    
    * Add tests for slang
    
    * Remove unused type definitions
    
    * Lint typescript files of slang
    
    * Add interruption actionType
    
    * Add sagas WIP
    
    For ny's reference
    
    * Add more interpreter actions
    
    * Change to older version of saga
    
    * Add notification file
    
    * Change es target to es2016
    
    This was the target in sourceacademy-2 as well. Without this, there was
    a problem with casting an `IterableIterator` to `yield*`, that expected
    an array.
    
    * Revert "Remove unused type definitions"
    
    This reverts commit e18f2ae3e1bd86380cc12285652ac204d01e6f65.
    "Oops" - @ningyuansg
    
    * Fix some slang errors
    
    * Make 16/05 code review changes
    
    Changes not made:
    - Change of `Playground` component to an `SFC`
    
    * Fix test snapshot (name of onChange for ReactAce)
    
    Due to 7ac707c.
    
    * Revert Playground as SFC, make Editor container
    
    * Make Playground stateless
    
    This is done by abstracting out the ace editor into its own component
    , `Editor`, and its own container to handle redux calls,
    `EditorContainer`.
    
    * Add test and fix export type
    
    Export of `Editor` changed to a default export, like the other
    components. A test has been added for the `Editor` component. Snapshot
    changes pending.
    
    * Fix type errors according to tslint
    
    * Change object methods to use es6 shorthand
    
    * Fix more linting errors for interpreter.ts
    
    * Disable `no-empty` rule.
    
    Rationale: A no-op function is much easier to see as `() => {}` as
    compared to `() => undefined` or even `() =>`. In addition, this syntax
    is used by parts of the interpreter as well.
    
    * Add `max-classes-per-file` exception for interpreter files
    
    Splitting the exports would cause futher refactoring in other parts of
    the interpreter codebase
    
    * Fix linting errors in parser, rules/braces...
    
    * Fix tslint errors in `parser`
    
    Exception was added for multiple class exports.
    
    * Format interpreter.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors in rules/*
    
    * Fix tslint errors for rttc.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for node.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for types.ts
    
    * Fix stdlib/list, stdlib/misc and scheudler tslint
    
    An additional change is the use of a line disable in `parser.ts` instead
    of an entire file disable.
    
    * Fix `saga` not being run after store creation
    
    * Fix Editor test (tslint errors)
    
    1. Missing comma in object props
    2. Syntax error and missing object comprehension in creating Editor
    
    * Add properties context, output to IPlaygroundState
    
    1. context is of type slang.Context. This holds the 'environment' for the slang
       interpreter
    2. Output is a string array that will hold the stdout/stderr (display, error
       calls) of a program run in the editor. For repl programs, it will also hold
       the return value of the program. Each element of an array is a historical
       output.
    
    * Add button to call on handleEvalEditor
    
    This change allows the newly added button to call upon the
    handleEvalEditor callback, whose reducer is not defined (yet)
    
    * Add mapDispatchToProps for EditorContainer
    
    Note that the intersection type is used with `Pick<T>` in order to
    define `DispatchProps`, this might not be ideal. Input on this issue
    would be appreciated.
    
    * Fix 'ace is undefined' error
    
    * Add Output SFC
    
    * Add output tests, did yarn format
    
    * Add 'run' button to EditorContainer
    
    * Change Editor snapshot to include button
    
    * Wire saga interpreter success to output SFC
    
    * Fix wrong file extension '.tsx' -> '.ts'
    
    'Oops' - ny
    
    * Move state definitions into their own file
    
    Fixes #7
    
    * Add type for interpreter outputs
    
    In addition, tslint rule `interface-over-type-literal` was disabled, due to the need
    for many types (that would not be extended)
    
    * Fix #11, using bindActionCreators
    
    * Add flexboxgrid dependency
    
    * Line Editor and Output up side to side
    
    * Refactor and modularise playground as IDE
    
    * Change Output to Repl
    
    This is to allow for the incoming repl, which will produce outputs as
    well.
    
    * Implement multiple Outputs in Repl (history)
    
    * Fix class playground not taking up all of parent
    
    * Make use of slang's toString to format values
    
    Previously, undefined would print as '' (empty string).
    
    * Make flexbox tags relative to current component
    
    * Make IPlaygroundState properties readonly
    
    Fixes #14
    
    * Add ReplInput (not wired to saga)
    
    * Replace TextArea with AceEditor
    
    Also change theme to dark background so we can debug better.
    
    * Move IDE buton to a separate Control component
    
    This is contained within the IDE component
    
    * Add property replValue to IPlaygroundState
    
    replValue, like editorValue, will store the contents of repl. It is used to
    allow the contents of the repl to persist through route changes. It is also the
    target for evaluation.
    
    * Make repl read from state.playground.replValue
    
    * Add evalRepl
    
    * Update Control snapshot with eval button
    
    * Add action UPDATE_REPL_VALUE
    
    * Implement persistent repl content across routes
    
    * Did yarn format
    
    * Add action clear repl
    
    Also removed unnecessarily verbose typings
    
    * Make eval button clear the replValue
    
    * Fix repl context resetting every eval
    
    TODO: Editor run needs to update playground context
    
    * Add keyboard shortcut for REPL
    
    * Fix formatting for repl shortcut
    
    * Errors are loosely represented as string 'error'
    
    * Fix yarn format git hooks passing for unformatted
    
    Previously, if the staged files are not formatted according to prettier, running
    the pre-commit hook would change the file formatting, and then return an exit
    code 0, allowing the commit to go through. However, the changes made by prettier
    are not staged.
    
    Now, the pre-commit hook will fail, so that only prettier-passed files can be
    committed.
    
    * Add ParseError in slang
    
    * Improve error messages to specify type of error
    
    * Improve CSS for repl output
    
    * Fix many error messages not printing on new lines
    
    Thank you stackoverflow
    
    * Fix editor not changing playground.context
    
    * Change ParseError to a function, parseError
    
    * Simplify REPL Output Component creation
    
    Turns out there's a 2-arity `map` that provides index
    
    * Rename playground css to ide
    
    * Change Playground to IDE in ide.css
    
    No visible change in effect. Regardless, this will probably be
    refactored once SCSS is introduced
    
    * Change "ClEAR_REPL" to "CLEAR_REPL_INPUT"
    
    This is to differenciate between the clearing of repl input and output
    
    * Add button and actions to clear REPL output
    
    - Button added
    - Action and reducer added
    
    * Make the clear button wipe the REPL context
    
    * Revert "Make clear button wipe the REPL context"
    
    I realised that source academy does not clear the context, and that
    clearing only the output is in line with most command-line applications
    and REPLs.
    This reverts commit 4bd3c443ae0b6fc45db5bae830254ca3037ac1fa.
    
    * Remove duplicate EditorContainer
    
    Was received from merging master into the branch
    
    * Fix button row in playground overflowing to right
    
    Would cause tiny bit of empty space on the right of the page, slightly outside
    the viewport.
    
    * Make run button clearReplOutput, remove default
    
    * Output code typed in ReplInput as Output
    
    * Use array method concat, reorder definitions
    
    Readability changes.
    
    * No verify commit, tests fails
    
    * Fix failing tests
    
    Okay, so slang's display needs access to the store in order to call dispatch, so
    that the display can be output'd in realtime. In the previous commit, this was
    achieved by importing the instantiated store from src/index.tsx into
    src/slang/stdlib/misc.ts.
    
    This works when the full server is running, but fails with the tests, because
    mockContext calls createContext, which imports stdlib/misc, which tries to
    import store. But because it's just a test, and store doesn't exist, the test
    fails.
    
    * Make run button interrupt execution
    
    * Make eval interrupt execution, remove notifs
    
    Next, change display so that if playground.output array is empty, initialise.
    
    * Fix display not working after a clear
    
    * Fix Eval button crashing site when Output[] empty
    
    This is because the Output SFC tries to access an undefined output.consoleLogs.
    
    output.consoleLogs is undefined after an Eval button click, because
    EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) will try to access the last element of
    playground.outputs, but the last element after playground.outputs is always a
    CodeOutput for Eval button presses; and CodeOutput doesn't have a consoleLogs
    property, so EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) copies over undefined as the new
    ResultOutput or ErrorOutput's consoleLog property.
    
    * Refactor display interactions with react/redux
    
    * Make RTTC errors fatal, add checks for unary
    
    RTTC errors (type errors found at runtime) will now interrupt execution of the
    program and return an error immediately.
    
    Checks for unary expression arguments have been implemented.
    
    * Update type rules for binary operators
    
    Function type checks not yet implemented
    
    * Fix typings not working for functions
    
    * Fix typings for logical expressions
    
    * Fix number + number raising error
    
    * Fix number (<|<=|>|>=) number raising error
    
    * Add tests, fix some errors with + operator
    
    * Revert typing restrictions for === and !==
    
    === and !== no longer raises errors.

    modules, e.g. acorn is already a dependency of webpack
    
    * Add tests for slang
    
    * Remove unused type definitions
    
    * Lint typescript files of slang
    
    * Add interruption actionType
    
    * Add sagas WIP
    
    For ny's reference
    
    * Add more interpreter actions
    
    * Change to older version of saga
    
    * Add notification file
    
    * Change es target to es2016
    
    This was the target in sourceacademy-2 as well. Without this, there was
    a problem with casting an `IterableIterator` to `yield*`, that expected
    an array.
    
    * Revert "Remove unused type definitions"
    
    This reverts commit e18f2ae3e1bd86380cc12285652ac204d01e6f65.
    "Oops" - @ningyuansg
    
    * Fix some slang errors
    
    * Make 16/05 code review changes
    
    Changes not made:
    - Change of `Playground` component to an `SFC`
    
    * Fix test snapshot (name of onChange for ReactAce)
    
    Due to 7ac707c.
    
    * Revert Playground as SFC, make Editor container
    
    * Make Playground stateless
    
    This is done by abstracting out the ace editor into its own component
    , `Editor`, and its own container to handle redux calls,
    `EditorContainer`.
    
    * Add test and fix export type
    
    Export of `Editor` changed to a default export, like the other
    components. A test has been added for the `Editor` component. Snapshot
    changes pending.
    
    * Fix type errors according to tslint
    
    * Change object methods to use es6 shorthand
    
    * Fix more linting errors for interpreter.ts
    
    * Disable `no-empty` rule.
    
    Rationale: A no-op function is much easier to see as `() => {}` as
    compared to `() => undefined` or even `() =>`. In addition, this syntax
    is used by parts of the interpreter as well.
    
    * Add `max-classes-per-file` exception for interpreter files
    
    Splitting the exports would cause futher refactoring in other parts of
    the interpreter codebase
    
    * Fix linting errors in parser, rules/braces...
    
    * Fix tslint errors in `parser`
    
    Exception was added for multiple class exports.
    
    * Format interpreter.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors in rules/*
    
    * Fix tslint errors for rttc.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for node.ts
    
    * Fix tslint errors for types.ts
    
    * Fix stdlib/list, stdlib/misc and scheudler tslint
    
    An additional change is the use of a line disable in `parser.ts` instead
    of an entire file disable.
    
    * Fix `saga` not being run after store creation
    
    * Fix Editor test (tslint errors)
    
    1. Missing comma in object props
    2. Syntax error and missing object comprehension in creating Editor
    
    * Add properties context, output to IPlaygroundState
    
    1. context is of type slang.Context. This holds the 'environment' for the slang
       interpreter
    2. Output is a string array that will hold the stdout/stderr (display, error
       calls) of a program run in the editor. For repl programs, it will also hold
       the return value of the program. Each element of an array is a historical
       output.
    
    * Add button to call on handleEvalEditor
    
    This change allows the newly added button to call upon the
    handleEvalEditor callback, whose reducer is not defined (yet)
    
    * Add mapDispatchToProps for EditorContainer
    
    Note that the intersection type is used with `Pick<T>` in order to
    define `DispatchProps`, this might not be ideal. Input on this issue
    would be appreciated.
    
    * Fix 'ace is undefined' error
    
    * Add Output SFC
    
    * Add output tests, did yarn format
    
    * Add 'run' button to EditorContainer
    
    * Change Editor snapshot to include button
    
    * Wire saga interpreter success to output SFC
    
    * Fix wrong file extension '.tsx' -> '.ts'
    
    'Oops' - ny
    
    * Move state definitions into their own file
    
    Fixes #7
    
    * Add type for interpreter outputs
    
    In addition, tslint rule `interface-over-type-literal` was disabled, due to the need
    for many types (that would not be extended)
    
    * Fix #11, using bindActionCreators
    
    * Add flexboxgrid dependency
    
    * Line Editor and Output up side to side
    
    * Refactor and modularise playground as IDE
    
    * Change Output to Repl
    
    This is to allow for the incoming repl, which will produce outputs as
    well.
    
    * Implement multiple Outputs in Repl (history)
    
    * Fix class playground not taking up all of parent
    
    * Make use of slang's toString to format values
    
    Previously, undefined would print as '' (empty string).
    
    * Make flexbox tags relative to current component
    
    * Make IPlaygroundState properties readonly
    
    Fixes #14
    
    * Add ReplInput (not wired to saga)
    
    * Replace TextArea with AceEditor
    
    Also change theme to dark background so we can debug better.
    
    * Move IDE buton to a separate Control component
    
    This is contained within the IDE component
    
    * Add property replValue to IPlaygroundState
    
    replValue, like editorValue, will store the contents of repl. It is used to
    allow the contents of the repl to persist through route changes. It is also the
    target for evaluation.
    
    * Make repl read from state.playground.replValue
    
    * Add evalRepl
    
    * Update Control snapshot with eval button
    
    * Add action UPDATE_REPL_VALUE
    
    * Implement persistent repl content across routes
    
    * Did yarn format
    
    * Add action clear repl
    
    Also removed unnecessarily verbose typings
    
    * Make eval button clear the replValue
    
    * Fix repl context resetting every eval
    
    TODO: Editor run needs to update playground context
    
    * Add keyboard shortcut for REPL
    
    * Fix formatting for repl shortcut
    
    * Errors are loosely represented as string 'error'
    
    * Fix yarn format git hooks passing for unformatted
    
    Previously, if the staged files are not formatted according to prettier, running
    the pre-commit hook would change the file formatting, and then return an exit
    code 0, allowing the commit to go through. However, the changes made by prettier
    are not staged.
    
    Now, the pre-commit hook will fail, so that only prettier-passed files can be
    committed.
    
    * Add ParseError in slang
    
    * Improve error messages to specify type of error
    
    * Improve CSS for repl output
    
    * Fix many error messages not printing on new lines
    
    Thank you stackoverflow
    
    * Fix editor not changing playground.context
    
    * Change ParseError to a function, parseError
    
    * Simplify REPL Output Component creation
    
    Turns out there's a 2-arity `map` that provides index
    
    * Rename playground css to ide
    
    * Change Playground to IDE in ide.css
    
    No visible change in effect. Regardless, this will probably be
    refactored once SCSS is introduced
    
    * Change "ClEAR_REPL" to "CLEAR_REPL_INPUT"
    
    This is to differenciate between the clearing of repl input and output
    
    * Add button and actions to clear REPL output
    
    - Button added
    - Action and reducer added
    
    * Make the clear button wipe the REPL context
    
    * Revert "Make clear button wipe the REPL context"
    
    I realised that source academy does not clear the context, and that
    clearing only the output is in line with most command-line applications
    and REPLs.
    This reverts commit 4bd3c443ae0b6fc45db5bae830254ca3037ac1fa.
    
    * Remove duplicate EditorContainer
    
    Was received from merging master into the branch
    
    * Fix button row in playground overflowing to right
    
    Would cause tiny bit of empty space on the right of the page, slightly outside
    the viewport.
    
    * Make run button clearReplOutput, remove default
    
    * Output code typed in ReplInput as Output
    
    * Use array method concat, reorder definitions
    
    Readability changes.
    
    * No verify commit, tests fails
    
    * Fix failing tests
    
    Okay, so slang's display needs access to the store in order to call dispatch, so
    that the display can be output'd in realtime. In the previous commit, this was
    achieved by importing the instantiated store from src/index.tsx into
    src/slang/stdlib/misc.ts.
    
    This works when the full server is running, but fails with the tests, because
    mockContext calls createContext, which imports stdlib/misc, which tries to
    import store. But because it's just a test, and store doesn't exist, the test
    fails.
    
    * Make run button interrupt execution
    
    * Make eval interrupt execution, remove notifs
    
    Next, change display so that if playground.output array is empty, initialise.
    
    * Fix display not working after a clear
    
    * Fix Eval button crashing site when Output[] empty
    
    This is because the Output SFC tries to access an undefined output.consoleLogs.
    
    output.consoleLogs is undefined after an Eval button click, because
    EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) will try to access the last element of
    playground.outputs, but the last element after playground.outputs is always a
    CodeOutput for Eval button presses; and CodeOutput doesn't have a consoleLogs
    property, so EVAL_INTERPRETER_(SUCCESS|ERRORS) copies over undefined as the new
    ResultOutput or ErrorOutput's consoleLog property.
    
    * Refactor display interactions with react/redux
    
    * Add Math obj, symbols NaN and Infinity
    
    Math: resolves #20,
    Symbols: resolves #16
    
    * Add Source §2 (#35)
    
    * Rename context.week -> context.chapter
    
    * Add list library
    
    TODO: Arrow functions do not work with map
    
    * Make context chapter 2 by default for dev
    
    * Fix arrow funcs not working with map/build_list...
    
    * Revert default libraries back to chap 1
    
    * Add sourceChapter property to playground state
    
    Playground defaults to most recent source chapter.
    
    * Add component for selecting source chapters
    
    Not yet wired.
    
    * Add action for chapter select
    
    Not yet wired up.
    
    * Add chapter select
    
    * Add section sign, notification on chapter change
    
    * Add list.equal

    Add "Stop" button (#27)
    
    * Add stop button
    
    * Add notification for interruption
    
    * Add isRunning state with switching 'Run' button
    
    When code is running (`isRunning == true`), Run button changes into a
    Stop button. The reverse is true.
    
    In addition, the soft block for async code execution, `put(actions.handleInterruptExecution())` was removed.

    Scaffold playground page (#8)
    
    * Add button for playground at Navbar
    
    No functionality.
    
    * Make first NavbarGroup's align left explicit
    
    * Change playground icon
    
    * Add routes to Playground
    
    * Update test snapshots
    
    * Fix bad test for Playground component
    
    Oops
    
    * Add react-ace for IDE
    
    * Try passing props into playground
    
    * Load a preset "Hello World" onto the ace editor.
    
    Changes:
    - Changed `Playground` component to a statefull one (extends `React.Component)
    - add property `playgroundCode` to IApplicationState (bad practice,
    change to a slice of the state instead)
    - add interface `IPlaygroundProps` to denote the properties passed to
    Playground
    
    * Remove unused onChange()
    
    * Add stored state for playground editor text
    
    Once again, this is a WIP. Text typed into the playground editor will
    stay in the playground (or rather, appear again) after leaving and
    coming back.
    
    Changes:
    - added of action, actionCreator (updatePlaygroundCode)
    - added a reducer under application's `reducer` function
    
    Possible problems:
    - Location of reducer
    - Location of playgroundCode stored (as in previous commit)
    
    * Change initialValue prop to editorValue
    
    * Made playground actions a separate file
    
    * Modify actions and dispatch call
    
    * Change redux import statement
    
    * Add IPlaygroundState to IState in index reducer
    
    * Add playground reducer
    
    * Remove playgroundCode from IApplicationState
    
    * Fix type errors
    
    Made a compromise by including an IPlaygroundState as part of IApplicationProps
    
    * Re-disable console.logs (tslint)
    
    * Fix missing imports for react-ace mode, theme
    
    * Add playground CSS
    
    * Add JSDoc style comments for playground
    
    * Fix some tests
    
    * Fix semantics of mapStateToProps for ApplicationContainer
    
    * Do trivial formatting
    
    * Make 16/05 code review changes
    
    Changes not made:
    - Change of `Playground` component to an `SFC`
    
    * Fix test snapshot (name of onChange for ReactAce)
    
    Due to 7ac707c.
    
    * Revert Playground as SFC, make Editor container
    
    * Make Playground stateless
    
    This is done by abstracting out the ace editor into its own component
    , `Editor`, and its own container to handle redux calls,
    `EditorContainer`.
    
    * Add test and fix export type
    
    Export of `Editor` changed to a default export, like the other
    components. A test has been added for the `Editor` component. Snapshot
    changes pending.
    
    * Fix test snapshots

    Add yarn command coverage, and helper script
    
    Files ending with *.d.ts in the project directory (excluding node_modules) will
    cause yarn test --coverage (i.e. yarn react-scripts-ts --coverage) to throw ~100
    lines of warning messages.
    
    To avoid this, the script coverage-fix.sh temporarily renames all *.d.ts files
    in the relevant directory ./src/ as *.ts files. Then, it runs just, and allows
    it to generate the coverage report smoothly. Finally, as clean-up, coverage-fix
    renames the affected *d.ts files (briefly *.ts) back to their original names.
